================
I cooperated with Professor Joshua Lampe to finish these tools, including:  
Tool 1--Power Factor Program: implemented a program to better represent the aorta pressure and aorta flow according to the Power Factor principles; visualized data in 2-D image.   
Tool 2--AMSA Score Program: implemented a program to better represent patients' health according to the AMSA Score algorithm; visualized data in 2-D image.   
Tool 3--Aorta Pressure Modeling: modeled aorta pressure and aorta flow; visualized the results in 3-D real time using Python MayaVI library.   
Tool 4--Fluorescence Extraction Program: implemented a program to automatically classify different blood spectrum; modeled blood spectrum using dirac delta function; implemented a program to extract fluorescence from blood spectrum.
